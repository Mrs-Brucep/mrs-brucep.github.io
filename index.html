        <h1>Our Village History</h1>
    <p>The Hidden Leaf Village is the first village to have been established. During the Warring States period the two most predominant clans the Senju and Uchiha clans often clashed. But Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha mended the animosity between the clans and created this scenic village decorated with leaves.
